## Overview
This will be my first challenge ever so I'm excited about it. I have recently finished a HTML and CSS course so I'm hopeful about seeeing where this leads to. Most likely I will be making a few mistakes along the road but considering my experience that should be understandable. 

## My process
I first focus on building the white box which my image is supposed to placed upon. After creating a div and giving it a height&width, I quickly try to center it on the screen.

After centering the white background, I try to create a blue box that looks similiar to the background of the QR Image (Unfortunately I had not checked the images folder at this point so therefore I was not aware that the blue box behind the QR Image was already there. So I thought I had to create it from scratch.)

After placing the white box and the image I focused on placing the texts. I downloaded the necessary font from Google Fonts made the sure the text was appropiate. While placing the texts I used em/rem measurements because that's what my instructor said is the best thing to do. Not sure if I did everything perfectly but I guess everything seems ok currently.


### What I learned
I guess in this project I learned (again) how to center a div horizontally and vertically. I also learned that before starting a project I should always check the material I'm given before anything else. If I had done so I could have saved myself an hour. I also learned how to think about responsive design considering the mobile view. Also it was good practice to update my files to Git.
